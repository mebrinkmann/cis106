## Basic Terminology

* **File system:** the way files are stored and organized
* **Current directory:** the directory where you are at the moment
* **parent directory:** the directory that precedes your current directory
* **the difference between your home directory and the home directory:** YOUR home directory is only accessible from your user profile. THE home directory is accessible by the admin of the system.
* **pathname:** indicates the location of the file in the file system
* **relative path:** the location of a file starting at the root of the file system
* **absolute path:** the location of a file starting from the current directory or a directory that is located inside the current directory.
